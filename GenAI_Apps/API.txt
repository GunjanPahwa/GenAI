1️⃣ REST API
REST API is not a tool or software.
It’s a set of rules / style for how two systems talk over the internet.

What REST means:
REST = Representational State Transfer

In practice, it means:
-You use HTTP
-You work with resources (users, jobs, posts, etc.)
-You use standard HTTP methods

Common REST methods:
1. GET	Read data
2. POST	Create data
3. PUT	Update all data	
4. PATCH	Update partial data	
5. DELETE	Remove data

REST APIs usually:
-Return JSON
-Are stateless (server doesn’t remember past requests)

2️⃣ FastAPI (the framework)

FastAPI is a Python framework used to build REST APIs.
REST = rules
FastAPI = tool to implement those rules

3️⃣ Postman (the testing tool)

Postman is NOT an API.
It’s a tool to test APIs.

What Postman does:
-Send GET / POST / PUT / DELETE requests
-Add headers, params, body
-See responses clearly
-Debug backend without frontend
